This collection will, with modifications, automagically enable cproot on a particular router.  Note it requires the following that you should provide:

1. A signing cert, used in make_lic.py.  "my_signing_cert" is the variable name that contains a string with your signing cert

2. _plt_client_key.py that includes "client_key" for PLT (get this from coconut)


run with:
	./enable_cproot.py <router_ip>


It will use get_plt.py to get the default password and mac address.

It will then request a new license from the license server, using the mac it
got from secured_plt.

It will then attempt to apply the license to the router, using the default
password from plt.  failing that, it'll try with my typical default router
password.  Obviously change this to suit your needs.
