The file router_ui_export.txt won't display anything, but it does "technically" work. This is because this example file only has data before the unit acquires the correct time, and the script discards anything with a timestamp of 1969/1970 (beginning of epoch time). That is why if you run the program on this file the display will be blank. It's not an error, just a bad example file of that format and an alternative wasn't able to be found.
